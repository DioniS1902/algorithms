### Laboratory work 2 (data structures)

One of the data structures should be implemented. Mine is *priority queue*.

You should perform the operations of inserting, returning an element without deleting, deleting (for example, returning and deleting the first element from the stack), and finding a specific element (if such an operation is supported by the data structure).
