# Lab-1
### Task
Implement a sorting algorithm - QuickSort(ascending/descending)

  ### Result output
  + Algorithm's name
  + Execution time
  + Counters: swaps, comparisons 
  + Sorting result
  
  ###  Code must be covered with tests
  + sort the input array
  + sort in ascending order of sorted array in ascending order
  + sort in descending order of sorted array in ascending order
  + sort in ascending order of sorted array in descending order
  + sort in descending order of sorted array in descending order
  
  ### How to run
  + Clone this repository with command `git clone https://github.com/DioniS1902/algorithms.git`
  + Choose branch quicksort with command `git checkout quicksort`
  + Go into folder with files with command `cd algorithms`
  + run command `python3 main.py -a <int array> or -r <number of elements> -o <asc/desc>` on Mac/Linux
  + run command `py main.py -a <int array> or -r <number of elements> -o <asc/desc>` on Windows
